# OpenDatr

Largely an unfinished/unfinishable opportunity to learn Scala.

This is a tool to convert random datasets you find on the internet into sensible formats you might use.

For example, Excel files to CSV, zip files of zip files of shapefiles to GeoJSON, etc.

It's in development. To use it, do this:

```bash
sbt "run path/to/file"
```

It won't do much yet though.

## Roadmap

* Get all of `MASTER_mps-figures_new.xls` resolving correctly

## License

It's all mine. Ask me about it though, I just haven't decided distribution yet
